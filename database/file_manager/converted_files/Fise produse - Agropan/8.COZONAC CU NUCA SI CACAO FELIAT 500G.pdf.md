## Product description
Made according to the traditional recipe, the cozonac smells of celebration, of roasted walnut and cocoa. It smells of the joy of being with all your loved ones and of customs we remember from when we were little. And the taste, the taste is like a journey back in time, to the mouth of the stove where the dance of the fire bakes the cozonac to a golden brown so that, later, we can savor it anywhere with delight. A staple on holiday tables, Panifcom's cozonac is an occasion for joy and flavor.
