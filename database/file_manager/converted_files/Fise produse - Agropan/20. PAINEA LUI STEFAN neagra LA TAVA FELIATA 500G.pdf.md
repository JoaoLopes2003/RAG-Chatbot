## Product benefits
Benefits of consuming sourdough bread:

Sourdough bread is a special product. The specific taste, the texture of the crumb, the crispy crust, the real health benefits, the care with which this bread is made - all are premises we consider when we set out to offer you the healthy and savory Ștefan's Bread.

It is miraculous how two simple ingredients such as water and flour can be transformed into something truly extraordinary: sourdough. Originating from Egypt, where it was first kneaded 3500 years ago, sourdough has considerable benefits.

- Sourdough leads to slower fermentation, the metabolism of the microorganisms involved not being forced in any way, and the biochemical processes take place naturally; thus, the resulting bread will be easier to digest. In the sourdough-risen dough, complex carbohydrates are partially broken down into simpler and more easily digestible sugars, and proteins into amino acids.
- Notable benefits also exist for diabetics or for people who want to maintain a balanced weight, as sourdough has a low glycemic index.
- As a living part of healthy bread, sourdough contains probiotics (lactobacillus), vital elements for the digestive system. Through natural rising, due to the benefits of the ferments, sourdough bread recreates the population of bacteria favorable to optimal digestion.
- Sourdough contains a multitude of vitamins: B1-B6, B12, E, magnesium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, as well as a large part of the nutrients in the cereal grain, released in forms easily assimilated by the body.  Sourdough gives the bread its particular taste - a slightly sour taste - which will always remind you of the bread made with such kindness by loved ones back home.
- Ștefan's sourdough Bread keeps its qualities longer than bread prepared exclusively with baker's yeast, qualities beneficial for a healthy and savory meal.
