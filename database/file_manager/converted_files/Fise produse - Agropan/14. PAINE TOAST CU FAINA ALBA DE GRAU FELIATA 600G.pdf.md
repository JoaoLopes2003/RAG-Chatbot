## Product description
Everything is tastier with a slice of warm, toasted bread, ready to be enjoyed with butter, sour cherry jam, or maybe a little cheese or honey. The fine, delicate taste, the crispy texture, the light consistency, all these attributes make the Toast bread from Panifcom the perfect combination with whatever is tastiest in the fridge. The Benefica Toast Bread is a top-quality bread that, without preservatives, maintains its freshness for a long time (24 days), thanks to the double protective packaging and the fact that it is a pasteurized product. Although the products have a shelf life of 24 days, the high preservability is not obtained through the addition of chemical substances, but through the innovative technological process used.
