## Product description
3 Grain Bread – a bread with whole wheat, rye, and oat flour, for those who want everything from a specialist in baking and healthy nutrition! The 3 Grain Bread is an ideal way to maintain our health without special efforts, while enjoying a special taste and aroma, conferred not only by the complex composition of the raw materials, but also by the production process with a semi-fluid starter, fermented for ~8 hours, necessary both for ensuring the microbiological stability of the final product and for the richness of aromas naturally resulting from the long fermentation process.
Why do children like it so much?
Its rich, slightly sweet taste and dense texture make this bread variety a perfect match for all the foods it comes into contact with, highlighting their freshness.

This product contains 3 types of WHOLEMEAL FLOUR:
- 60% whole WHEAT flour,
- 5% whole RYE flour
- 2% whole OAT flour.

## Product benefits
By milling the whole grains, all the nutritional components from the grain's structure are kept together: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. In usual processes, only the endosperm is kept, but the nutritional ratio is diminished. The grain's bran contains most of its fiber, vitamins, enzymes, and mineral salts. The germ contains almost all the lipids and proteins of the grain, as well as mineral salts and vitamins, while the endosperm is mostly composed of starch. The wholemeal flour, together with the added seeds, provides the body with a daily bonus of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, and proteins.

### 3 reasons to be sure you've made a wonderful choice:
1.  **Beauty**
    Whole wheat contains proteins, vegetable fibers, vitamins, mineral salts (phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium salts), as well as other active principles with antioxidant roles. The content of mineral salts helps to maintain the blood vessels in very good condition. Its long-term consumption helps to detoxify the body, thus preventing all forms of cancer of the digestive tract, constipation, colitis, and obesity.
2.  **Energy**
    The contribution of whole rye and oat flour. Besides the generally valid benefits of whole flours, the "3 Grain Bread - The Miller's Secret" also brings the fact that it is made of 3 WHOLE GRAINS, containing, in addition to WHEAT, WHOLE RYE AND WHOLE OATS. Rye is a cereal rich in manganese, selenium, phosphorus, and magnesium, as well as vitamins A, B, E, and K. It contributes to the biosynthesis in the body of enzymes responsible for the proper use of glucose and for the secretion of insulin, necessary for good digestion.
3.  **Freedom**
    Oats – through their high fiber content, participate in detoxifying the body, are effective for restoring appetite, lower cholesterol, lower blood sugar, prevent the onset of cardiovascular diseases, and act as a thyroid stimulant.

### The benefits of wholemeal flour compared to regular flour
The structure of the cereal grain is as follows:
- The bran represents 12-16% of the total mass, contains most of the fiber from the grain's structure, vitamins, mineral salts, and enzymes.
- The germ, 2-3% of the grain's mass, contains almost 100% of the lipids and proteins of the wheat grain, as well as vitamins and mineral salts.
- The endosperm, 80-85% of the total mass, is composed mostly of starch and very few proteins.

While the bran and germ have complex botanical roles, hence their structure rich in fiber and nutrients, the endosperm is just a food reserve for the sprouting process. As human food, it is rich in energy but poor in nutrients. Modern processing of cereals has allowed the separation of bran and germ which, being rich in proteins, enzymes, antioxidant substances, and fats, confer a degree of microbiological and biochemical instability to flours. Practicing this method leads to obtaining white flours with a reduced content of bioactive principles. However, by milling the grains whole, without any sifting, all the remarkable components of the grain's structure are kept together, resulting in wholemeal flour, a complex product and an ideal raw material for wholemeal bread, a functional food rich in active principles, an indispensable component of a complete and healthy diet.
Wholemeal flours contain: Proteins (13 – 15 g%); Vegetable fibers (10 – 15%); Vitamins; Mineral salts; flavones (with antioxidant roles).
