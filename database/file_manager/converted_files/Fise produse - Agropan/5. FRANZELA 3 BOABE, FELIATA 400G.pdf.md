## Product description
3 Grains Bread - a bread with whole wheat, rye, and oat flour, for those who want everything from a specialist in baking and healthy nutrition!

3 Grains Bread is an ideal way to maintain our health without special efforts, while enjoying a special taste and aroma, conferred not only by the complex composition of the raw materials but also by the production process with semi-fluid sourdough, fermented for ~8 hours, necessary both to ensure the microbiological stability of the finished product and for the richness of the aromas resulting naturally from the long fermentation process.

Why do children love it so much?
Its rich, slightly sweet taste and dense texture make this type of bread a perfect match for all the foods it comes into contact with, highlighting their freshness.

This product contains 3 types of WHOLE FLOUR:

- 60% whole WHEAT flour,
- 5% whole RYE flour
- 2% whole OAT flour.

## Product benefits
By grinding the whole grains, all the nutritional components in the structure of the grain are kept together: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. In usual procedures, only the endosperm is kept, but the nutritional ratio is diminished.

- The grain's bran contains most of its fiber, vitamins, enzymes, and mineral salts. The germ contains almost all the lipids and proteins in the grain, as well as mineral salts and vitamins, while the endosperm is mainly composed of starch. Whole-grain flour, together with the added seeds, provides the body with a daily boost of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, and proteins.

3 reasons to make sure you've made a wonderful choice:

1. Beauty

Whole wheat contains proteins, vegetable fibers, vitamins, mineral salts (phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium salts), as well as other active ingredients with antioxidant properties. The mineral salt content helps maintain blood vessels in very good condition. Its long-term consumption helps detoxify the body, thus preventing all forms of cancer of the digestive tract, constipation, colitis, and obesity.

The contribution of whole rye and oat flour

Besides the generally valid benefits of whole-grain flours, "3 Grains Bread - The Miller's Secret" also brings the fact that it consists of 3 WHOLE GRAINS, besides WHEAT, also containing WHOLE RYE and WHOLE OATS.

2. Energy

Rye is a cereal rich in manganese, selenium, phosphorus, and magnesium, as well as vitamins A, B, E, and K. It contributes to the biosynthesis in the body of enzymes responsible for the good use of glucose and the secretion of insulin, necessary for good digestion.

3. Freedom

Oats - due to their high fiber content, participate in detoxifying the body, efficiently restoring appetite, lowering cholesterol, lowering blood sugar, preventing cardiovascular diseases, and stimulating the thyroid.


The benefits of whole wheat flour compared to regular flour

The structure of cereal grains is as follows:

- The bran represents 12-16% of the total weight, contains most of the fiber in the grain, vitamins, mineral salts, and enzymes.
- The germ, 2-3% of the grain's weight, contains almost 100% of the lipids and proteins in the wheat grain, as well as vitamins and mineral salts.
- The endosperm, 80-85% of the total weight, is mostly composed of starch and very little protein.

While the bran and germ have complex botanical roles, hence their rich structure in fiber and nutrients, the endosperm is just a food reservoir for the germination process. As human food, it is rich in energy but poor in nutrients. Modern cereal processing has allowed the separation of bran and germ which, being rich in proteins, enzymes, antioxidants, and fats, confer a degree of microbiological and biochemical instability to flours. Practicing this method leads to obtaining white flours with a reduced content of bioactive principles.

However, by grinding the grains whole, without any sifting, all the remarkable components in the structure of the grain are kept together, resulting in wholemeal flour, a complex product and an ideal raw material for wholemeal bread, a functional food rich in active principles, an indispensable component of a complete and healthy diet. Whole-grain flours contain: Proteins (13-15g%); Vegetable fibers (10-15%); Vitamins; Mineral salts; flavones (with an antioxidant role).
