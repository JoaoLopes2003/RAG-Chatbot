## Product description
It smells of celebration, of grandmother's hands, of roasted walnut and of goodies that must rest on a white tablecloth. It smells of the joy of being with all your loved ones and of customs we remember from when we were little. And the taste is like a journey back in time, to the mouth of the stove where the dance of the fire bakes the Moldovan Cozonac to a golden brown so that, later, we can savor it with delight. A staple on holiday tables, the hearty Moldovan Cozonac from Panifcom is an occasion for joy, in the sweet classic style, hand-kneaded, from milk and butter, then sprinkled with almonds.
