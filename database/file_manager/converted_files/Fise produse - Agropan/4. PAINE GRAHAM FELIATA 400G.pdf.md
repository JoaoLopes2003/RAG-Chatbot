## Product description
Eggplant salad always chooses Graham bread from Panifcom. So do butter, aged telemea cheese, tomatoes, and quince jam. Why? Well, the story is as simple as can be, just like the bread we offer you: satiety, taste, in every slice of Panifcom Graham bread. Alongside his name, Sylvester Graham left a healthy diet based on the consumption of a bread that contains only wholemeal flour, obtained by crushing the grain, thus leaving a large bran.
