## Product Description

Made according to the traditional recipe, the cozonac smells like a holiday, like roasted walnuts and cocoa. It smells like the joy of being with all our loved ones and the customs we remember from our childhood. And the taste, the taste is like a journey through time, to the stove where the dancing fire browns and prepares the cozonac so that we can then savor it anywhere with gusto. A must-have on holiday tables, Panifcom's cozonac is an occasion for joy and flavor.
