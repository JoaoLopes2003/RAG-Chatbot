## Product description
3 Grains Bread - whole wheat, rye and oat flour bread, for those who want everything from a specialist in baking and healthy nutrition!

3 Grains Bread is an ideal way to maintain our health without special efforts, while savoring a special taste and aroma, conferred not only by the complex composition of the raw materials, but also by the production process with semi-fluid sourdough, fermented for ~8 hours, necessary both to ensure the microbiological stability of the finished product and for the richness of the aromas resulting naturally from the long fermentation process.

Why do children love it so much?
Its rich, slightly sweet taste and dense texture make this type of bread a perfect match for all the foods it comes into contact with, highlighting their freshness.


This product contains 3 types of WHOLE FLOUR:

*   60% WHOLE WHEAT flour,
*   5% WHOLE RYE flour
*   2% WHOLE OAT flour.



## Product benefits

By grinding the grains whole, all the nutritional components in the structure of the grain are kept together: the bran, the germ and the endosperm. In conventional procedures, only the endosperm is kept, but the nutritional value is diminished.

*   The bran contains most of the fiber in its structure, vitamins, enzymes and mineral salts. The germ contains almost all the lipids and proteins in the grain, as well as mineral salts and vitamins, while the endosperm is mainly composed of starch. Whole grain flour, together with the added seeds, provides the body with a daily dose of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals and proteins.


3 reasons to make sure you've made a wonderful choice:

1.  Beauty
Whole wheat contains protein, vegetable fiber, vitamins, mineral salts (phosphorus, magnesium and calcium salts), as well as other active ingredients with antioxidant properties. The content of mineral salts helps maintain blood vessels in very good condition.
Its long-term consumption helps detoxify the body, thus preventing all forms of cancer of the digestive tract, constipation, colitis and obesity.


Whole rye and oat flour intake
In addition to the generally recognized benefits of wholemeal flour, "3 Grain Bread - The Miller's Secret" also brings the fact that it is made of 3 WHOLE GRAINS, besides WHEAT, also containing WHOLE RYE and WHOLE OATS.

2.  Energy
Rye is a cereal rich in manganese, selenium, phosphorus and magnesium, as well as vitamins A, B, E and K. It contributes to the biosynthesis in the body of enzymes responsible for the proper use of glucose and the secretion of insulin, necessary for good digestion.

3.  Freedom
Oats - due to its high fiber content, participates in the detoxification of the body, being effective for restoring appetite, lowering cholesterol, lowering blood sugar, preventing cardiovascular diseases, stimulating the thyroid.



Benefits of whole wheat flour compared to regular flour
The structure of cereal grains is as follows:

*   The bran represents 12-16% of the total weight, contains most of the fiber in the structure of the grain, vitamins, mineral salts and enzymes.
*   The germ, 2-3% of the grain's weight, contains almost 100% of the lipids and proteins in the wheat grain, as well as vitamins and minerals.
*   The endosperm, 80-85% of the total weight, is mostly composed of starch and very little protein.


While the bran and germ have complex botanical roles, hence their rich structure in fiber and nutrients, the endosperm is only a food reservoir for the germination process. As human food, it is rich in energy, but poor in nutrients. Modern cereal processing has allowed the separation of the bran and germ, which, being rich in proteins, enzymes, antioxidants and fats, give a degree of microbiological and biochemical instability to flours. This method leads to white flours with reduced content of bioactive principles.


However, by grinding the whole grains, without any sifting, all the remarkable components in the structure of the grain are kept together, resulting in whole grain flour, a complex product and an ideal raw material for whole wheat bread, a functional food rich in active principles, an indispensable component of a complete and healthy diet. Whole grain flour contains: Protein (13 - 15 g%); Vegetable fiber (10-15%); Vitamins; Mineral salts; flavones (with antioxidant role).
